| 3   | Data Fetching        | Where your data lives and how to get it.                                                  |
| 4   | Rendering            | When and where you render static or dynamic content.                                      |
| 5   | Integrations         | What third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them. |
| 6   | Infrastructure       | Where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).      |
| 7   | Performance          | How to optimize your application for end-users.                                           |

\*_For each part of your application, you will need to decide whether you will build a solution yourself or use other tools such as libraries and frameworks._

### 2. What is React?

> [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) is a `JavaScript library` for building interactive **user interfaces(UI)**.

By library, we mean React provides helpful functions to build UI, but leaves it **up to the developer where to use** those functions in their application.

### 3. What is Next.js?

> [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) is a `React framework` that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

## From JavaScript to React

### 1. Rendering User Interfaces

When a user visits a web page, the server returns an HTML file to the browser. Then the browser reads the HTML and constructs the DOM.

- [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)

  1. An object representation of the HTML elements
  2. A bridge between your code and the user interface
  3. A tree-like structure with parent and child relationships

- **Imperative** vs **Declarative** Programming

  1. DOM Methods: An imperative Programming

     - Imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza.
     - Ex. "Knit the dough, roll the dough, add tomato sauce, add cheese, add ham, add pineapple, bake at 200 degrees celsius in a stone oven for...‚Äù

     ```html
     <!-- index.html -->
     <html>
       <body>
         <div id="app"></div>

         <script type="text/javascript">
           // Select the div element with 'app' id
           const app = document.getElementById("app");

           // Create a new H1 element
           const header = document.createElement("h1");

           // Create a new text node for the H1 element
           const headerContent = document.createTextNode(
             "Develop. Preview. Ship. üöÄ"
           );

           // Append the text to the H1 element
           header.appendChild(headerContent);

           // Place the H1 element inside the div
           app.appendChild(header);
         </script>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```

  2. React: A declarative UI library

     - Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza.
     - Ex. ‚ÄúA Hawaiian pizza please.‚Äù

### 2. Getting Started with React

1. **react**
   - The core React library
2. **react-dom**
   - Provides DOM-specific methods that enable you to use React with the DOM

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <!-- Babel Script -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/jsx">
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
      ReactDOM.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship. üöÄ</h1>, app);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- You need a JavaScript compiler, such as a **Babel**, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.
- React is a library that contains reusable snippets of code that perform tasks on your behalf - in this case, updating the UI.

\*_If you‚Äôd like to learn more, take a look at the [UI trees](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#the-ui-tree) and the [render method](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/render) sections in the React Documentation._

### 3. Building UI with Components

User interfaces(UI) can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.

```jsx
const app = document.getElementById("app");

function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship. üöÄ</h1>;
}

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Nesting the Header component */}
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}

// Capitalize the React Component
ReactDOM.render(<HomePage />, app);
```

### 4. Displaying Data with Props

Using props

```jsx
// function Header(props) {
//   return <h1>{props.title ? props.title : "Default title"}</h1>;
// }

function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{title ? title : "Default title"}</h1>;
}

function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="React üíô" />
      <Header title="A new title" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Iterating through lists

```jsx
function HomePage() {
  const names = ["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper", "Margaret Hamilton"];

  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship. üöÄ" />
      <ul>
        {names.map((name) => (
          <li key={name}>{name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Adding Interactivity with State

```jsx
function HomePage() {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState()

  function handleClick() {
    setLikes(likes + 1)
  }}

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Likes ({likes})</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

\*_If you‚Äôd like to learn more, take a look at the [Adding Interactivity](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/adding-interactivity) and [Managing State](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/managing-state) sections in the React Documentation._

## From React to Next.js

```bash
npm install react react-dom next
```

- pages/index.jsx

  ```jsx
  import { useState } from "react";

  function Header({ title }) {
    return <h1>{title ? title : "Default title"}</h1>;
  }

  export default function HomePage() {
    const names = ["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper", "Margaret Hamilton"];

    const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);

    function handleClick() {
      setLikes(likes + 1);
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship. üöÄ" />
        <ul>
          {names.map((name) => (
            <li key={name}>{name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>

        <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

- package.json

  ```json
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev"
  },
  ...
  ```

> You removed the babel script, a taste of the complex tooling configuration you no longer have to think about.
